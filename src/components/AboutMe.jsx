        <div className="about__text">
          <p>
            I have always been passionate about learning, whether it&apos;s
            building software and web applications or mastering new skills. I
            studied Computer Science at the University of Leeds and recently
            completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp at Northcoders to sharpen
            my skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to become a successful Full Stack Software Developer.
            It&apos;s incredible to think that 15 years ago, I was living on an
            island, barely able to introduce myself in Englishâ€”yet today,
            I&apos;m pursuing a tech career in England. That journey still
            amazes me!
          </p>
          <p>
            Teaching myself English has been my greatest achievement. It opened
            doors to opportunities I never imagined possible and shaped the
            person I am today. Because of this, I&apos;m passionate about
            helping others on their English learning journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I run a YouTube channel, &apos;English with Bruno McDowell,&apos;
            where I share practical tips, lessons, and advice to help learners
            improve their English skills in a fun and engaging way. If
            there&apos;s one thing I&apos;ve learned, it&apos;s this: dreams do
            come true when you believe in them and put in the work.

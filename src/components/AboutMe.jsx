      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am passionate about learning in general and building Software
        Applications. I studied Computer Science at The University of Leeds and
        have did a Boot-camp in Software Engineering at Northcoders.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My goal is to become a successful Software Developer. In 5 years I see
        myself working as a Full Stack Software Developer. 15 years ago I was
        living on an Island and could hardly introduce myself in English. This
        is mind blowing!
      </p>
      <br />
      
      <p>
        Teaching myself English has been my greatest achievement, as it has
        unlocked doors to opportunities and enabled me to achieve things that I
        could not have done otherwise. Dreams do come true when you believe it
        and work hard.

          Beyond software development, I am also passionate about helping people
          improve their English communication skills. <br /> I create engaging
          content on YouTube (English with Bruno McDowell) and TikTok, where I
          share:

          1 - Practical English lessons to help learners sound natural and
          confident. <br /> 2 - Pronunciation tips to refine fluency. Real-life
          conversations and expressions that learners can use every day. <br />{" "}
          3 - Common mistakes to avoid when speaking English.
